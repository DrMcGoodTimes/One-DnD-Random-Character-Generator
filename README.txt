Hey there, this is the code I've written to make an app that randomly selects options for you to make a character origin using the One D&D Playtest Materials.

Is it the best code you've ever seen?  Nah.  But this is the first real project I'm making outside of following tutorials, so it is mostly for the purposes of learning and creating.

I'm going to try and update this project regularly, adding more features as more playesting materials are dropped.

I did the initial work for this over the course of a weekend and I'm just making the repo now, which is why it isn't really starting at the beginning.  But I consider that a positive, so you can't see all the poor design decisions I made initially.

But yeah, have fun with it.
